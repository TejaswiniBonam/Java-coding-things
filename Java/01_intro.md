## Why Learn Java?

Java is a widely-used, versatile programming language known for its portability, reliability, and strong community support. Learning Java can help you:

- Build cross-platform applications that run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- Develop Android apps, enterprise software, web applications, and more.
- Gain a solid foundation in object-oriented programming concepts.
- Access a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools.
- Improve your career prospects, as Java is in high demand across many industries.
- Portability with WORA
- Security cuz it runs on virtual Machines




## What is a Programming Language?

A programming language is a set of instructions that allows people to communicate with computers. It lets you write code to tell the computer what to do, such as performing calculations, storing information, or creating applications.

## some random termminology

* **low level language** - a type of programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's hardware. Low level languages, such as assembly or machine code, are closely related to the instructions that a computer's processor can execute directly. They are typically harder for humans to read and write but offer more control over hardware resources.
* **high level language** - a type of programming language that provides strong abstraction from the computer's hardware. High level languages, such as Java, Python, or C#, are designed to be easy for humans to read and write. They handle many hardware details automatically, allowing developers to focus on solving problems rather than managing system resources.


* **Algorithm** - process
* **Syntax** - format, Or rules of writing something
* **Forward compatibility** - means that software or systems designed today can work with future versions or updates. For example, a Java program written for an older version of Java may still run on newer versions of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), as long as the newer JVM maintains support for older features.
* **Backward compatibility** - means that newer versions of software or systems can still work with files, programs, or data created with older versions. In Java, this often means that code compiled with a newer version of the Java compiler can still run on older JVMs, provided no new language features or APIs are used that the older JVM doesn't support.


# History of Java
* **James Gosling**
* company - sun Micro systems
* Java was created in 1995.
* Originally called "Oak," it was renamed to Java.
* Designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
* Its main goal was to allow developers to **"write once, run anywhere" (WORA)**.
        * Generally compilers convert high level to low level.. But In java compiler converts high level to intermediatary(**byte code or object code**).. and then JVM does the intermediate to low level.
* Java quickly became popular for web and enterprise applications.
* In 2010, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems and took over Java development.


## Does C++ Support "Write Once, Run Anywhere"?

C++ does not fully support the "Write once, run anywhere" (WORA) philosophy like Java. While C++ code can be compiled for many platforms, it often requires modifications and recompilation for each target system due to differences in compilers, operating systems, and hardware. Java, on the other hand, uses the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to run the same compiled bytecode on any platform with a compatible JVM, making true WORA possible.




* Byte code is not 0/1.. source code is human code.. use of byte code? let say if u want to give the algo to someone and thay must not copy your code send byte code..
* bytecode isn't readable.



# numbers
## numeric conversions
* **Implicit conversions** - int to double - no data loss
* **Explicit conversions** - double to int - data MAY lose
*
